#'@MS: I suggest dividing it into two seperate functions, one for the NCD model (see rHelperFunctions:return.sim.state.size.distribution) and another one for your HIV model
#'we want to maximize the functions' usability accross the code and minimize redundant definitions 
#'can be moved to either rHelperfunctions or plot.R depending on how generalizable the function is 
#'@PK: okay, moved to plots file now
#'
#'
#'@MS: please add a description for this function (and others if missing): document what each function input is
#'@MS: can you extend this function to include NCD status too? #'@PK - but the HIV model doesn't report NCD statuses?
